/**
 * 1. Approach:
 *
 * - Challenge requires simple functions. I didn't see the need for classes or
 *   anything fancy;
 * - To achieve the solution of the challenge different tasks are required, and
 *   so, breaking all these tasks into function that perform specific operations
 *   are better. And function can be used later on (DRY);
 * - Challenge is math-related. Calculate the factorial is direct and simple.
 *   The breaking the number into digits parts that took me a bit more time to
 *   figure it out.
 *
 * 2. Correctness
 *
 * - First, problems specifies and clear interval. So made sure only valid
 *   values are allowed. Tested this individually;
 * - Since code has several functions, I tested each function individually as
 *   well. First factorial, then split into digits and last the sum of digits;
 * - Testing the factorial function I was worried with the upper and lower
 *   limits. factorial of 0 must be equals 1. That is correct. But when testing
 *   upper limit I checked that values is not being corrected calculates. Number
 *   is too big! Values greater than 65 are not calculated correctly.
 *
 * 3. Optimization
 *
 * - I watched for unsigned numbers, since we are only dealing with positive
 *   numbers;
 * - For factorial result used boost::multiprecision::mpz_int type, since it
 *   stores greater numbers;
 * - If memory was really really an issue, the code could be reorganized to be a
 *   single functions to avoid some variables and copies, like the std::vector;
 *
 *  * Obs: I would break the related function on its own library. but kept it
 *         all here for ease of reading.
