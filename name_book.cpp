/**
 * 1. Approach:
 * - Problems was pretty simple. But a class was a good fit so data and
 *   behaviors related to NameBook was handled by itself;
 * - If a file with names is provided object NameBook can handle the input read;
 * - If no file with names is provided on object creation, object has a default
 *   constructor and names can be added in two flavors: by file name, or name by
 *   name;
 * - NameBook self validate its consistency via method IsConsistent()
 *   following the given rule;
 *     - IsConsistent() only cares if name BEGINS with the other name;
 *     - Others cases of substring were not considered;
 *
 * 2. Correctness
 * - Checked by ways of adding names:
 *     - Default construct and after read file;
 *     - Construct with file name;
 *     - Add name by name
 * - Verify different names input to check for problems
 *     - Names beginning with other names;
 *     - Names that have a substring of other names by not at position 0;
 *     - File with no names -> is consistent since there is no name violating
 *       the consistency rule;
 *  - A good unit test was needed. But I guess it is not the main goal here.
 *
 * 3. Optimization
 * - Decided to use std::vector. It is as class with low overhead over standard
 *   arrays;
 * - But, more importantly, std::vector allow random access, and at cost O(1);
 * - Decided to check name_1 against name_2 on the same loop. This way the
 *   number of time I had to iterate on vector is reduced; Loop inside loop is
 *   always something to watch for;
 *
 * Obs: I would break class on its own .cpp and .h file. but kept it all here
 *      for ease of reading.
 *
 * New changes:
 * - method IsConsistent() is executing for last element without any need, but
 *   to avoid that, we have to check is list is empty before loop. It would be
 *   changing one IF for another; Decide to keep it;
 * - IsConsistent() was kept for comparisons, because new approach does not need
 *   it;
 * - Code was changed to verify consistency of name list when name is
 *   being added to name list;
 * - To keep track of consistency state, a new attribute 'consistent_' was
 *   created;
 * - For this version, without the need of method IsConsistent(), std::vector is
 *   not mandatory, but still a good choice since it is fast and has
 *   little overhead. No need for a double linked list as std::list
