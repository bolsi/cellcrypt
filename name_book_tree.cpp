/**

/**
 * 1. Approach:
 * - Problems was pretty simple. But a class was a good fit so data and
 *   behaviors related to NameBook was handled by itself;
 * - If a file with names is provided object NameBook can handle the input read;
 * - If no file with names is provided on object creation, object has a default
 *   constructor and names can be added in two flavors: by file name, or name by
 *   name;
 * - NameBook encapsulates a tree structure where each node is a letter of the
 *    name; following the given rule;
 * - Consistency only cares if name BEGINS with the other name;
 * - Others cases of substring were not considered;
 *
 * 2. Correctness
 * - Checked by ways of adding names:
 *     - Default construct and after read file;
 *     - Construct with file name;
 *     - Add name by name
 * - Verify different names input to check for problems
 *     - Names beginning with other names;
 *     - Names that have a substring of other names by not at position 0;
 *     - File with no names -> is consistent since there is no name violating
 *       the consistency rule;
 *  - Names with exact same size are OK
 *  - Tested node and tree alone to check if data was being corrected added, and
 *    collision detected;
 *  - A good unit test was needed. But I guess it is not the main goal here.
 *
 * 3. Optimization
 * - As requested, new data structure to store the names is now a tree;
 * - New solution really detects faster a consistency problem with names;
 * - If there are several similar or equal names memory can be saved with this
 *   approach;
 *
 * Obs: I would break class on its own .cpp and .h file. but kept it all here
 *      for ease of reading.
 *
 * Obs1: This approach is more complex and error prone. A good unit test is
 * really needed;
 *
 * Obs2: if input names batch being validated every time is small, or all names
 * are really different among themselves, all the overhead structures for every
 * letter may consume more memory;
